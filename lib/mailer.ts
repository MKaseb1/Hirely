// Sends the OTP verification email over the company mail server's SMTP
// relay via nodemailer, replacing Resend. Resend's free sandbox sender
// (onboarding@resend.dev, no verified domain) only delivers to the email
// address that owns the Resend account — which made it impossible to
// test signup with any other address.

// pins us to the mail server's implicit-TLS port (465) rather than letting
// the shorthand pick, and gives connectionTimeout below something concrete
// to apply to. Also fails fast with a clear message instead of a raw
// ECONNRESET if the connection can't be established within 10s, since a
// hung SMTP handshake is otherwise indistinguishable from "still trying."
