// lib/rootAdmin.ts

// The root admin — the one account that can approve/decline pending admin
// signups and triage support requests — is configured entirely through env
// vars (ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASS) rather than seeded, so that
// changing those two values on the server is enough to rotate credentials
// without touching the DB. There's exactly one root at a time (whichever
// email is currently in the env), and no way to promote a regular admin
// through the UI — that would defeat the point of having a hardcoded root.

// decide whether to seed on login and to short-circuit "existing account?"
// checks in the register route — the root can't sign up through the UI.

// Idempotently makes sure the DB has a row matching the env-configured
// root admin — creates it if missing, resets password/role/approved on
// every call so env-var changes take effect on the next login attempt
// (no server restart or seed script needed). Safe to call every login;
// bcrypt.hash is the only real cost.
//
// Called from /api/auth/login BEFORE the credential check, so the
// credential check itself compares against the freshly-hashed env
// password and doesn't need any special-casing.
