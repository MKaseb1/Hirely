// resolution, same as before. If it's a create missing required fields,
// we don't dump the whole list — we return just the FIRST missing field
// to ask about.
//
// Mode B — expectedField is set: the client is answering ONE specific
// question. We run a tiny, targeted extraction for just that field,
// validate it with real rules, and either move to the next missing
// field or finish.
